Welcome to the 484 Roboforce Programmer test. If you're reading this, that means you've already passed the first part,
that being cloning Git repositories. While technically optional, it would benefit you greatly to read this welcome message 
before continuing on with the test. You may notice that autocomplete and the changing of the color of words are disabled.
this is intentional. All trainees taking the test will have to code with proper syntax from memory (Within reason, we're not 
gonna fail you over a semicolon). Now that that's all said and done, let's start off with the rules:

1. You may use any values you want when creating a variable, so long as it conforms to the rules of said variable type.
2. You may use any name you like for objects, unless otherwise specified.
3. Any syntax error relating to undefined variables or objects, or syntax errors relating to missing IDs, channels, etc.,
will have no negative impact on your score.
4. You must score 80% or higher to pass this test.
5. Upon completion of the test, DO NOT push your changes to the Github. instead, this test is to be completed during meeting
hours and shown to any programmer who has already passed the test.
6. Your fellow programmers can help explain any questions you may not understand, but cannot help you reach the answer.
7. You are allowed to use nonexistant objects and variables. You only need to create an object or variable when
 specifically told to do so. I mean, you can if you want to, but it's not at all required.
